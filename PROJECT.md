# Federal Regulations Analysis Project

## Overview

The United States Federal Government has over 200,000 federal regulations across ~150 main agencies, all of which can be found within the eCFR at https://www.ecfr.gov/. There is a public API for it.

The goal of this assessment is to create a website JSON API to analyze Federal Regulations to allow for more digestible and actionable insights to be made on potential deregulation efforts across the government.

## Instructions

1. We designed all components of this assignment to be completed between 4 and 6 hours, excluding setup, but please take more time if needed.

2. Please write code to analyze the existing eCFR and display the size of each federal agency's regulations.
   - The JSON API you provide should return each agency's name correlated with the data size in Megabytes of regulations in the eCFR for that agency.
   - The content returned by this API should reflect changes to the regulations in the eCFR within 24 hours of those changes being published, without modifying the API source code.

3. Build a functioning deployment of your JSON API that is not hosted on your local machine.
